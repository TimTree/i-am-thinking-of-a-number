**Works on smartphones, tablets, and desktop devices**

I am Thinking of a Number takes a sophisticated approach to tried-and-true number guessing.

* Guess with a number set or an input field.
* Choose any combination of integers to guess from.
* Use hints to assist with guessing.
* Toggle between light and dark themes.

## About the Project

This game originally released in 2010 on PowerPoint, titled "I am Thinking of a Number Between 1 and 1,000." Simply put, it was a prank game intended to mess with people.

In 2013, I ported "I am Thinking of a Number Between 1 and 1,000" to the Web. It was, after all, a simple game to convert, and it could finally generate random numbers to guess from. Over time, I transformed the game, adding hints, multiple number ranges, and refinements to make the project less of a prank and more of something viable.

## Building the Game

This project does not use any JavaScript frameworks. Simply download and edit the source directly to work with the game.
